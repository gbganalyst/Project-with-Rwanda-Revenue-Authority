# On Job training

1. Getting insight with RRA domain. This includes:
      1. Taxation theory
      2. BI and DWH
      
2. Insight on the various data that were used in the publication of \textit{Tax Statistics in Rwanda}.

# Managing and responding to various requests of data

1. Splitting sales annex \textit{big data} that was used by IMF team in the exercise of estimating VAT tax expenditure for Rwanda.

## Summary of the file

The file was more than 20 million rows, it was difficult to work with that size with local processing software such as Excel, SPSS and Stata. We used \textbf{\#Rstats} to do data wrangling by tidying the data, split the data on a monthly and quarterly basis so that IMF can carry further work on it.

# Managing and responding to various requests of data

2. Contributed to data prepared for MINICOM with regards to the value of transactions made by firms registered in Made in Rwanda policy.

The request was to do analysis based on \textbf{TIN}, \textbf{Business Income} and \textbf{Taxes}.


# Managing and responding to various requests of data
3) Quarterly payment of domestic taxes  for Manufacturing Vs Non-manufacturing from  2007 to 2018_Q1

\textbf{Summary of the analysis}

Taxpayer's period year was classified according to tax period quarters, and the payment was classified according to manufacturing and non-manufacturing companies.

# Managing and responding to various requests of data
5)	Handling big data for VAT sales annexes 

Data wrangling was done for VAT sales annex data 2013 -2017 by deleting confidential information. The data were used by the researcher from Harvard University working with IGC on the Consumer Incentives project to evaluate the EBM lottery and potential rebate system.

#

**Summary of the file**

The VAT sales annexes data are Big data with more than 30 million rows just for one fiscal year.

---

Twelve (12) RRA staff followed the training for \textit{\textbf{R for data science}} (R programming language). The training was held in the offices of Planning and Research Department.

The staff came from Planning and Research Department and Risk Management Departments, especially in the following units:

*	Statistics Division (P & RD)
*	Research Division (P & RD)
*	Corporate Planning Division (P & RD)
*	BI & DWH unit (P & RD)
*	IT_Risk Management (RMD)

Also, 4 interns in Planning and Research Department attended the training.

# Demonstrating R code

```{r, echo=T,eval=TRUE}
data <- tribble(
  ~`Unit(s)`,~	`Number of attendees`,
'AIMS Interns (Trainers)', 2,
'Statistics unit', 3,
'Research unit' , 2,
'Planning unit'	,2,
'IT_ Risk management unit', 2,
'BI & DWH unit',	2,
'Interns in R&P, and RMD', 4,
'ODI fellow',1,
'Total',18)
```


# Output of R codes

```{r}
#knitr::kable(data,row.names = T,caption = 'List of participants in the R for data science training')
```

```{r,echo=F, results='asis'}
print.xtable(xtable(data,caption='List of participants in the R for data science training',digits = 0),caption.placement ='top',comment = F)
```


# What we covered during R session training

R programming language was introduced to the staff for the first time. We covered some syntax that will prepare them for the use of R and make their R programming enjoyable. 

* Various atomic data types and structures
* Data import to R and export from R. 
* R packages for data wrangling
* Data manipulations and analysis
* Data visualization
