# Terms of Reference

As it is in the \textit{AIMS/RRA} terms of references, the AIMS interns will contribute to various analyses done in Planning and Research Department and automate some of the key analyses.

# On Job training

1. Insight with RRA domain. This included:
      1. Taxation theory
      2. BI and DWH
      
2. Insight on the various data that were used in the publication of \textit{Tax Statistics in Rwanda}. 
3. Attended IMF training on models to estimate Tax expenditure for Rwanda : the training was held at Hotel des Milles Collines, from June 18 to June 22, 2018

# Managed and responded to various requests of data

1. Split sales annex \textit{big data} that were used by IMF team in the exercise of estimating VAT tax expenditure for Rwanda.

## Summary of the file

The file was more than 20 million rows, it was difficult to work with that size with local processing software such as Excel, SPSS and Stata. We used \textbf{\#Rstats} to do data wrangling by tidying the data, split the data on a monthly and quarterly basis so that IMF would carry further work on it.

# Managed and responded to various requests of data

2. Contributed to data prepared for MINICOM with regards to the value of transactions made by firms registered in Made in Rwanda policy.

The request was to do analysis based on \textbf{TIN}, \textbf{Business Income} and \textbf{Taxes}.


# Managed and responded to various requests of data
3) Quarterly payment of domestic taxes  for Manufacturing Vs Non-manufacturing from  2007 to 2018_Q1

## Summary of the analysis

Taxpayer's period years were classified according to quarters and tax payment was classified according to manufacturing and non-manufacturing companies using \textbf{ISIC} code.

# Managing and responding to various requests of data
4)	Handling big data for VAT sales annexes 

Data wrangling was done for VAT sales annex data 2013-2017 by deleting confidential information. The data were used by the researcher from Harvard University working with IGC on the Consumer Incentives project to evaluate the EBM lottery and potential rebate system.

## Structure of the file

The VAT sales annexes data were Big data with more than 30 million rows just for one fiscal year.

# R for data science training class

![R for data science training](Images\training_1.jpg)

---

Twelve (12) RRA staff followed the training for \textit{\textbf{R for data science}} (R programming language). The training was held in the offices of Planning and Research Department.

The staff came from Planning and Research Department, and Risk Management Department, especially in the following units:

*	Statistics Division (P & RD)
*	Research Division (P & RD)
*	Corporate Planning Division (P & RD)
*	BI & DWH unit (P & RD)
*	IT_Risk Management (RMD)

Also, 4 interns in Planning and Research Department attended the training.

# R codes demonstration

```{r, echo=T,eval=TRUE}
data <- tribble(
  ~`Unit(s)`,~	`Number of attendees`,
'Statistics unit', 3,
'Research unit' , 2,
'Planning unit'	,2,
'IT_ Risk management unit', 2,
'BI & DWH unit',	2,
'Interns in R&P, and RMD', 4,
'ODI fellow',1,
'Total',16)
```


# Output of R codes

```{r}
# kable(data,"latex", booktabs=T,caption = "List of participants in the R for data science training") %>% kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"))
```

```{r,echo=F, results='asis'}
print.xtable(xtable(data,caption='List of participants in the R for data science training',digits = 0),caption.placement ='top',comment = F)
```


# What we covered during R session training

R programming language was introduced to the staff for the first time. We covered some syntax that will prepare them for the use of R and make their R programming enjoyable. 

* Various atomic data types and structures
* Data import to R and export from R. 
* R packages for data wrangling
* Data manipulations and analysis
* Data visualization
